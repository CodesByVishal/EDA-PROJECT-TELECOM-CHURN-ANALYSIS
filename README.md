# Orange Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

Orange S.A., formerly known as France Télécom S.A., stands as a prominent multinational telecommunications corporation, catering to a vast customer base. The Orange Telecom's Churn Dataset presents a trove of cleaned customer activity data (features) alongside a churn label, denoting whether a customer has terminated their subscription. The primary objective of this analysis is to delve into the depths of this dataset, uncover the key factors contributing to customer churn, and propose actionable recommendations aimed at enhancing customer retention strategies.

## Business Objectives

1. **Identifying Key Causes of Customer Churn**: The analysis aims to explore the dataset thoroughly, seeking to unveil the underlying factors driving customer churn within the Orange Telecom subscriber base.

2. **Providing Retention Strategies**: Through a comprehensive examination of the data, the objective is to formulate strategic steps aimed at retaining valuable customers and mitigating churn, ultimately fostering a more robust customer retention framework.

## Guidelines

In pursuit of achieving the outlined business objectives, adherence to the following guidelines is imperative:

- **Code Structure**: The codebase should exhibit a well-structured, neatly formatted, and comprehensively commented architecture, ensuring clarity and ease of comprehension for future reference.

- **Exception Handling**: Robust exception handling mechanisms must be integrated into the codebase to bolster its resilience and ensure its reliability under varying circumstances.

- **Deployment Readiness**: Striving for deployment-ready code is crucial, whereby the entire .ipynb notebook should be executable seamlessly without encountering any errors or inconsistencies, thereby facilitating seamless deployment into production environments.

- **Commentary**: A meticulous commentary should accompany each logical segment of the code, offering detailed insights into the rationale behind each decision made during the analysis process, thereby enhancing transparency and facilitating collaboration.

## Analysis Approach

The analysis will follow a structured approach, encompassing the following key phases:

1. **Data Exploration**: Commence by delving into the dataset, meticulously examining its structure, the distribution of variables, and any inherent patterns or anomalies present within the data.

2. **Feature Analysis**: Undertake a granular analysis of individual features within the dataset, aiming to discern any discernible patterns, correlations, or trends that may shed light on the factors influencing customer churn.

3. **Visualization**: Harness the power of data visualization techniques to encapsulate key insights and trends, leveraging an array of charts, graphs, and visual aids to elucidate complex relationships within the data effectively.

4. **Churn Prediction**: Employ advanced machine learning algorithms to construct predictive models capable of forecasting customer churn, subsequently evaluating the efficacy of these models through rigorous performance assessment metrics.

5. **Recommendation Formulation**: Synthesize the insights gleaned from the analysis to craft a series of actionable recommendations and strategies aimed at fortifying the organization's customer retention efforts and minimizing churn rates.

## Expected Deliverables

The culmination of the analysis will yield a diverse array of deliverables, including:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: A comprehensive and exhaustive analysis offering deep insights into various facets of the dataset, spanning descriptive statistics, distributional analyses, and feature correlations.

- **Machine Learning Model**: A robust churn prediction model meticulously crafted through the application of advanced machine learning techniques, offering the capability to forecast customer attrition with a high degree of accuracy.

- **Recommendation Report**: A detailed and meticulously curated report outlining actionable recommendations and strategic initiatives aimed at bolstering customer retention efforts and fostering a more resilient and sustainable business model.
